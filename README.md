# Lasso Regression Implementation Using Python

This repository contains a simple and clear implementation of Lasso
Regression using Python and the scikit-learn library. The project focuses
on understanding L1 regularization and its impact on regression models.

## About Lasso Regression
Lasso Regression (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a
linear regression technique that applies L1 regularization. It helps in:
- Reducing overfitting
- Performing feature selection
- Improving model generalization

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Implementation Steps
1. Import required libraries
2. Load and preprocess the dataset
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train Lasso Regression model
5. Make predictions
6. Evaluate model performance
7. Visualize results

## Model Used
- Lasso Regression (sklearn.linear_model.Lasso)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anshika135/lasso-regression-implementation.git
